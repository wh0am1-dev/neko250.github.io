    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Mi poesía favorita, &ldquo;El Hombre de la Luna Descendió con Premura&rdquo;.</h3>

<p>The Man in the Moon had silver shoon,<br/>
and his beard was of silver thread;<br/>
With opals crowned and pearls all bound<br/>
about his girdlestead,<br/>
In his mantle grey he walked one day<br/>
across a shining floor,<br/>
And with crystal key in secrecy<br/>
he opened an ivory door.</p>

<p>On a filigree stair of glimmering hair<br/>
then lightly down he went,<br/>
And merry was he at last to be free<br/>
on a mad adventure bent.<br/>
In diamonds white he had lost delight;<br/>
he was tired of his minaret<br/>
Of tall moonstone that towered alone<br/>
on a lunar mountain set.</p>

<p>He would dare any peril for ruby and beryl<br/>
to broider his pale attire,<br/>
For new diadems of lustrous gems,<br/>
emerald and sapphire.<br/>
He was lonely too with nothing to do<br/>
but stare at the world of gold<br/>
And heark to the hum that would distantly come<br/>
as gaily round it rolled.</p>

<p>At plenilune in his argent moon<br/>
in his heart he longed for Fire:<br/>
Not the limpid lights of wan selenites;<br/>
for red was his desire,<br/>
For crimson and rose and ember-glows,<br/>
for flame with burning tongue,<br/>
For the scarlet skies in a swift sunrise<br/>
when a stormy day is young.</p>

<p>He’d have seas of blues, and the living hues<br/>
of forest green and fen;<br/>
And he yearned for the mirth of the populous earth<br/>
and the sanguine blood of men.<br/>
He coveted song, and laughter long,<br/>
and viands hot, and wine,<br/>
Eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes<br/>
and drinking thin moonshine.</p>

<p>He twinkled his feet, as he tought of the meat,<br/>
of pepper, and punch galore;<br/>
And he tripped unaware on his slanting stair,<br/>
and like a meteor,<br/>
A star in flight, ere Yule one night<br/>
flickering down he fell<br/>
From his laddery path to a foaming bath<br/>
in the windy Bay of Bel.</p>

<p>He began to think, lest he melt and sink,<br/>
what in the moon to do,<br/>
When a fisherman’s boat found him far afloat<br/>
to the amazement of the crew,<br/>
Caught in their net all shimmering wet<br/>
in a phosphorescent sheen<br/>
Of bluey whites and opals lights<br/>
and delicate liquid green.</p>

<p>Against his wish with the morning fish<br/>
they packed him back to land:<br/>
‘You had best get a bed in an inn’, they said;<br/>
‘the town is near at hand.’<br/>
Only the knell of one slow bell<br/>
high in the Seaward Tower<br/>
Announced the news of his moonsick cruise<br/>
at that unseemly hour.</p>

<p>Not a hearth was laid, not a breakfast made,<br/>
and dawn was cold and damp.<br/>
There were ashes for fire, and for grass the mire,<br/>
for the sun a smoking lamp<br/>
In a dim back-street. Not a man did he meet,<br/>
no voice was raised in song;<br/>
There were snores instead, for all folk were abed<br/>
and still would slumber long.</p>

<p>He knocked as he passed on doors locked fast,<br/>
and called and cried in vain,<br/>
Till he came to an inn that had light within,<br/>
and tapped at a window-pane.<br/>
A drowsy cook gave a surly look,<br/>
and ‘What do you want?’ said he.<br/>
‘I want fire and gold and songs of old<br/>
and red wine flowing free!’</p>

<p>‘You won’t get them here’, said the cook with a leer,<br/>
‘but you may come inside.<br/>
Silver I lack and silk to my back<br/>
-maybe I’ll let you bide.’<br/>
A silver gift the latch to lift,<br/>
a pearl to pass the door;<br/>
For a seat by the cook in the ingle-nook<br/>
it cost him twenty more.</p>

<p>For hunger of drouth naught passed his mouth<br/>
till he gave both crown and cloak;<br/>
And all that he got, in an earthen pot<br/>
broken and black with smoke,<br/>
Was porridge cold and two days old<br/>
to eat with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>For puddings of Yule with plums, poor fool,<br/>
he arrived so much too soon:<br/>
An unwary guest on a lunatic quest<br/>
from the Mountains of the Moon.</p>
